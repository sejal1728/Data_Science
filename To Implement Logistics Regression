Explanation:
This model considers both horsepower and miles per gallon as predictors.
If probability ≥ 0.5, predict 'Straight engine' (vs = 1).
If probability < 0.5, predict 'V-shaped engine' (vs = 0).

The model with the lowest AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) value is generally considered the best model for prediction.
In your case:
•	Model 1: AIC = 29.53334
•	Model 2: AIC = 20.83758
•	Model 3: AIC = 22.80297
Since Model 2 has the lowest AIC value, it is the best model for prediction among the three.
