1. One Sample T-Testing
Use: Compares the mean of a sample to a known value or population mean.

# Defining sample vector
x <- rnorm(100)

# One Sample T-Test
t.test(x, mu = 5)

2. Two Sample T-Testing
Use: Compares the means of two independent samples to determine if they are significantly different.

# Defining sample vectors
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)

# Two Sample T-Test
t.test(x, y)

3. Directional Hypothesis
Use: Tests whether the sample mean is greater or smaller than a known population mean in a specified direction.

# Defining sample vector
x <- rnorm(100)

# Directional hypothesis testing
t.test(x, mu = 2, alternative = 'greater')

4. One Sample μ-Test
Use: Non-parametric test to compare the median of a sample to a known value.

# Define vector
x <- rnorm(100)

# One sample test
wilcox.test(x, exact = FALSE)

5. Two Sample μ-Test
Use: Non-parametric test to compare the medians of two independent samples.

# Define vectors
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)

# Two sample test
wilcox.test(x, y)

6. Correlation Test
Use: Tests the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

# Using mtcars dataset in R
cor.test(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)
